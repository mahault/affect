    "This demonstration is designed to monitor the emotional dynamics of an agent as it navigates through the task of locating its wallet within a domestic setting. The core of this demonstration is the deployment of an emotional inference framework, structured as a hierarchical active inference model. This model is bifurcated into two distinct levels: the foundational level, where the agent is engaged in the practical task of wallet retrieval, and the elevated \"hier\" level (a nomenclature chosen to indulge in a pun), which is tasked with performing emotional analysis based on the lower level's activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we introduce a baseline scenario, termed the wallet-finding-only task, which operates without the integration of the emotional inference system. This scenario serves as a control to contrast against the comprehensive emotional-wallet-finding task, thereby facilitating a comparative analysis of the two approaches."
